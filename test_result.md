  Reset the heavy multi-tenant VayuERP into a SIMPLE DMS matching two requirement docs.
  Only two workflows: (1) Primary Sales — Owner ↔ Distributor, (2) Secondary Sales — Distributor ↔ Retailer.
  Simple, clean, minimum clicks. Ignore all existing ERP/analytics/BI features.
  Currency INR. Mobile-responsive web. Simple in-app notifications. 8 demo roles.

  ITERATION 1 (this run) — Primary Sales complete:
    * Owner: create categories, products (with box_qty, INR pricing, HSN, GST), auto price-batches on price change
    * Owner: onboard distributors with full KYC (GSTIN, PAN, license, bank)
    * Owner: per-distributor product visibility toggles
    * Owner: browse distributor list, view details, inventory
    * Distributor: browse only permitted products (with old vs new price display), place order (box qty × price = total)
    * Owner: receives notification → fulfills line-by-line → fulfillment % auto-computed →
             mark Ready to Go → auto e-Bill → owner inventory decrements → primary ledger debit
    * Distributor: receives notification → marks order Received → distributor inventory increments
    * Owner Accountant: primary ledger view, record payments, attach invoice docs
    * Notifications bell + unread badge, polling 30s

          Built complete /api/dms/* router with:
          - Categories CRUD
          - Products CRUD + auto price-batch on price change (previous_price shown to distributor)
          - Owner inventory (with adjustments + stock ledger)
          - Distributors CRUD + KYC + per-product visibility toggles
          - Distributor browse (only visible products) + owner_stock_boxes shown
          - Primary orders lifecycle: place → fulfill lines → auto fulfillment% → ready_to_go (auto e-bill + inventory move + primary ledger debit) → received (moves stock into distributor inventory)
          - Attachments (invoice URL uploads) linked to orders
          - Primary ledger with per-distributor summary (billed/paid/outstanding) + payment recording
          - Simple in-app notifications with unread badge
          - Owner + Distributor + placeholder role dashboards
          Verified end-to-end via curl: order placed → 2 lines fulfilled 5+2 → 88% → ready → e-bill EB-* → distributor received → primary_ledger shows outstanding ₹27,376 → notifications delivered.

          ✅ COMPREHENSIVE BACKEND TESTING COMPLETE — ALL 11 SCENARIOS PASSED (11/11)
          
          Tested all /api/dms/* endpoints with comprehensive test suite covering:
          
          1. ✅ AUTH + SEED VERIFICATION
             - All 5 accounts login successfully (owner, owner_accountant, dist1, dist2, dist_accountant)
             - JWT contains correct tenant_id="tnt-dms-oil"
          
          2. ✅ CATEGORIES (owner-only)
             - GET: 5 categories exist
             - POST: Owner can create category → 200
             - PUT: Owner can update category → 200
             - DELETE: Owner can delete category → 200
             - POST as distributor → 403 (correct authorization)
          
          3. ✅ PRODUCTS + PRICE BATCHES
             - GET: 12 products with category_name, box_qty, unit_price populated
             - POST: New product created with initial price batch
             - PUT: Price change from ₹5000 → ₹5500 correctly:
               * previous_price set to 5000
               * unit_price updated to 5500
               * Two price batches created (older has to_date set, newer has to_date=null)
             - GET price-history: Returns 2 batches correctly
          
          4. ✅ DISTRIBUTORS + KYC + VISIBILITY
             - GET: 2 distributors with full KYC (GSTIN populated)
             - POST: New distributor created with full KYC payload
             - New distributor user can login successfully
             - GET visibility: All products visible=true by default
             - PUT visibility: Product hidden (visible=false) works
             - Hidden product NOT in distributor browse
             - Hidden product NOT in distributor products list
             - Owner still sees all products (visibility filtering works correctly)
          
          5. ✅ DISTRIBUTOR BROWSE
             - GET /api/dms/distributor/browse returns 13 products
             - Products with previous_price show both old + new (1 product with price history)
             - All products have owner_stock_boxes field
          
          6. ✅ PRIMARY ORDER FULL LIFECYCLE (Most Critical)
             - POST order: Created with 2 items (5+3 boxes), status=pending, fulfillment_pct=0
             - Distributor sees their order
             - Owner sees the order
             - Fulfill line A: 5 boxes → 62% fulfillment
             - Fulfill line B: 2 out of 3 boxes → 88% fulfillment, status=partially_fulfilled
             - Mark ready: status=ready_to_go, e-bill generated (₹27,376)
             - Owner inventory decremented correctly (Product A: -5, Product B: -2)
             - Primary ledger has invoice entry
             - Distributor receives order: status=received
             - Cannot receive again → 400 (correct)
             - Other distributor cannot receive → 403 (correct security)
          
          7. ✅ ATTACHMENTS
             - POST attachment as owner_accountant → 200
             - GET attachments by reference_id → returns attachment
             - GET order includes attachments array
          
          8. ✅ PRIMARY LEDGER + PAYMENTS
             - GET ledger: Has entries and summary with billed/paid/outstanding
             - Outstanding before payment: ₹54,752
             - POST payment: ₹5,000 recorded
             - Outstanding after payment: ₹49,752 (correctly reduced)
          
          9. ✅ NOTIFICATIONS
             - GET notifications: 4 notifications with unread count
             - POST mark read: Works correctly
             - POST read-all: Unread count becomes 0
          
          10. ✅ DASHBOARDS
              - Owner dashboard: All KPIs present (distributors=3, products=13, revenue_mtd=₹54,752, outstanding=₹49,752, inventory_value=₹2,467,600)
              - Distributor dashboard: All KPIs present (stock_boxes=14, payable_to_owner=₹49,752)
              - Stock boxes > 0 from received order (correct)
          
          11. ✅ CROSS-TENANT / SECURITY
              - Other distributor cannot access order → 403 (correct)
              - Retailer can access distributors endpoint (returns 3 distributors, no crash)
          
          🎯 CRITICAL FLOWS VERIFIED:
          - Complete order lifecycle: place → fulfill → ready → e-bill → receive
          - Inventory movements: Owner stock decremented, distributor stock incremented
          - Financial tracking: Ledger entries, payments, outstanding calculations

      ITERATION 1 — SIMPLE DMS PRIMARY SALES COMPLETE.

      Old multi-tenant VayuERP modules are archived on disk (untouched) but hidden from
      the frontend. Any /app/* URL now redirects to /dms. Backend endpoints for old
      modules still exist but are not exposed in the UI.

      NEW backend endpoints (all under /api/dms/*):
        - Categories, Products, Price batches
        - Owner inventory + adjustments + stock_ledger
        - Distributors with KYC + product visibility toggles
        - Distributor browse (visibility-filtered)
        - Primary orders lifecycle (place → fulfill → ready → received)
        - E-bills, attachments, primary ledger, payments
        - Notifications (bell + polling)
        - Dashboards per role

      NEW frontend routes:
        - /login (new brand)
        - /dms (role-based dashboard)
        - /dms/owner/{categories, products, distributors, distributors/:id, primary-orders, primary-orders/:id, inventory, ledger}
        - /dms/distributor/{browse, my-orders, my-orders/:id, stock, ledger}
        - Other roles see clean "Coming in Iteration 2" placeholders with feature list.

      Please regression-test the Primary Sales flow end-to-end:
        1. Owner login (owner@dms.com / Demo@2026) → see 12 products, 2 distributors, ₹24.9L inv
        2. Owner creates a new category + product with initial price ₹5000
        3. Owner edits the product's price to ₹5500 → verify old price kept + new batch created
        4. Distributor Amit login → verify all 12 products visible + prices correct
        5. Owner opens Amit's profile → visibility tab → hide 1 product → distributor's browse
           should no longer show that product
        6. Distributor places an order of 3–4 items → verify total calculated correctly (subtotal + GST)
        7. Owner sees notification bell +1 → opens order → fulfill lines partially (e.g. 3 out of 5)
           → verify fulfillment % updates
        8. Owner clicks Mark Ready to Go → verify:
             - status → ready_to_go
             - e-bill created
             - owner inventory decremented
             - primary_ledger has "invoice" entry
             - distributor gets notification
        9. Distributor sees notification → opens order → clicks Mark Received → verify:
             - status → received
             - distributor inventory incremented
             - owner gets notification
        10. Owner Accountant login → primary ledger → see outstanding → Record Payment ₹5000
             → verify outstanding decreases
        11. Notifications bell shows unread badge → click item → marked read

      Iteration 2 (after user sign-off) will build Secondary Sales (Distributor ↔ Retailer),
      Sales Team (Salesperson punch-in/GPS + Team Leader + Regional Manager), and
      Super Admin Login-As control panel.
